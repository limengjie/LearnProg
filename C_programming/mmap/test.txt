Helloneral, no matter the database you are using, check to make sure there is a Full text option and check that box on your search screen to return full text records in your search results. If the database does not contain full text records, there should be link resolvers that take you to other library resources that may have the full text. If you still find nothing after searching a variety of databases, you can always try Google Scholar as linked from the library's main page, which also links to our database content. Also, use Get It For Me if you cannot find the item - article requests are usually processed fairly quickly. Last, you can always try  a general Internet search for full text articles - sometimes another educational institution or online archive may post full article content, but if you reach a publisher page asking for money for the article, please do not pay for the article but use the Get it For Me service.
